This website is planned as an unofficial companion book for [Introduction to the New Statistics](https://www.routledgetextbooks.com/textbooks/9781138825529/) by Geoff Cumming and Robert Calin-Jageman (2017, New York: Routledge) or for short _ITNS_. 

The website follows the structure of the printed book and offers additional material in three aspects:

+ It explains how to apply the provided statistical knowledge from the book to [R](https://www.r-project.org/), a language and open-source environment for statistical computing and graphics. It shows and explains how to solve the end-of-chapter exercises of <i>itns</i> with the help of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), an open-source integrated development environment (IDE), especially suited to support the R language.
+ To foster your knowledge with R, the website contains interactive tutorials to use and get some practice with the R programming language.  It uses the R packages [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/), [gradethis](https://rstudio-education.github.io/gradethis/) for creating interactive R tutorials and [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) a package to build interactive web apps straight from R. You will learn essential R packages and study how to solve statistical tasks and challenges with them.
+ A third component consists of exercises developed with [H5P](https://h5p.org), an open-source framework to create interactive activities for checking and reinforcing understanding (e.g., interactive videos, quizzes, and games) based on [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). 

This website does not repeat or summarize the book's instructions. To enjoy the interactive tutorials on this website, you have to read and/or consult the relevant content in the book. The website supports this parallelism by providing the same chapter structure as the book.


## Educational concept

-min.png" width="250" height="375" alt="Cover image" align="left" style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em"/>

We want to showcase breaking down theoretical notions into a massive amount of interactive exercises using multiple representations.  Multiple representations are different types of representations presented to learners to help them understand an issue more deeply. Students of statistics, for example, are provided with textual descriptions, scatterplots, and math formulas to the same subject or question. To prevent so-called inert knowledge, we challenge learners additionally with interactive activities built around functional and practical environments.  

## Suggestions, critiques and bug reports are appreciated

Our professional background is further education and educational technology; hence not statistics, data science, nor programming. Therefore we are pleased to receive critical feedback, suggestions, and bug reports.
