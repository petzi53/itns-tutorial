<strong>Info:</strong> In *ITNS* there are many occasion where students are motivated to "pause, reflect, and discuss" the issues just explained and some question posed by the authors. This is meant to take notes by paper & pencil, so a digital version would only be a bad substitute. Especially as in the work of Mueller and Oppenheimer (2014) it turned out, that students on average remembered more after taking notes with pen than with laptop.
